## ES6 Basic

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is the latest version of JavaScript. It introduced several new features and improvements to the language. Some of the key features include:

- **let and const:** introduced new ways to declare variables with block scope (`let`) and constants (`const`).
- **Arrow Functions:** a shorter syntax for writing functions.
- **Destructuring:** allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into individual variables.
- **Promises:** a built-in way to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Classes:** a syntax for defining classes, which can have methods and properties.

This project will help you understand the syntax and features of ES6.
